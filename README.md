# StudentInformationManagement
   ABSTRACT

The Student Information System (SIS) is a modern digital solution designed to improve student data management and communication within educational institutions. It centralizes student records, course details, and administrative information, offering a user-friendly interface for administrators, instructors, and students. Features include student record storage, course management, real-time updates, attendance tracking, and a communication hub. The SIS streamlines administrative processes, enhances communication, and empowers educators for better student success.

ARCHITECTHURE:

•	Client (Presentation Layer):

o	The client layer represents the user interface or the part of the application that users interact with directly. In the context of your SIS project, this could include web pages, forms, and user interfaces through which students, instructors, and administrators interact with the system.
•	Local Host (Business Layer):

o	The local host layer is often referred to as the business logic layer. It is responsible for handling the core functionality and business logic of the application. In your SIS project, this layer would contain the code that manages student records, course enrollment, attendance tracking, grading, and other essential operations. It processes requests from the client layer and interacts with the database layer for data retrieval and storage.
•	Database (Data Access Layer):

o	The database layer serves as the data access layer and is responsible for managing the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. In your SIS project, you mentioned using the JDBC driver, which connects your application to the database (e.g., PostgreSQL). This layer handles database interactions, including executing SQL queries, updating records, and ensuring data consistency and integrity.
